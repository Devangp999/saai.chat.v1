# SaAI Response Formatting

## Overview

The SaAI Chrome extension now includes automatic response formatting that converts unstructured text responses from your backend into professional, well-organized, and visually appealing content. This addresses the challenge of receiving raw, unstructured responses that are difficult to read and understand.

## What It Does

The `formatUnstructuredResponse()` function automatically detects and formats:

1. **Markdown Headers** - Converts "### News" into styled section headers
2. **Numbered Lists** - Converts "1. **Device**: ..." into styled sections
3. **Bold Headers** - Formats "**Device**:" into highlighted field labels
4. **Vendor Responses** - Creates special blue-tinted sections for vendor communications
5. **Next Steps** - Creates green-tinted sections for action items
6. **Bullet Points** - Formats "- item" into styled list items
7. **Citations/References** - Formats "[1][2]" into highlighted reference numbers
8. **Source Links** - Creates organized source sections with clickable links
9. **Content Paragraphs** - Formats long text into readable paragraph blocks
10. **News Headlines** - Formats "News: ..." into prominent purple-tinted sections
11. **General Text** - Applies consistent typography and spacing

## Example Transformations

### Sample Response #1 - Simple Text

**Before (Raw):**
```
Based on the email thread regarding the NeuroTrack NX-500 replacement, a tracking ID wasn't explicitly mentioned. The support team requested for an inspection to be scheduled before proceeding with the replacement. If you have any more specific keywords or information, I can refine the search.
```

**After (Formatted):**
- Text is wrapped in a clean, readable container
- Proper line spacing and typography applied
- Consistent with the extension's design system

### Sample Response #2 - Markdown with Headers & Sources

**Before (Raw):**
```

**After (Formatted):**
- **### News** becomes a prominent section header with bottom border
- **### Sources:** becomes a styled section header
- Citations like [1][2] become highlighted reference numbers
- Source links are organized in a structured yellow section
- All URLs become clickable links with hover effects
- Content is properly spaced and organized

## Implementation Details

### Function: `formatUnstructuredResponse(text)`

Located in `content.js`, this function:

1. **Detects Patterns**: Uses regex to identify different response structures
2. **Applies Formatting**: Converts plain text to HTML with CSS classes
3. **Maintains Structure**: Preserves the logical flow of information
4. **Adds Visual Hierarchy**: Uses colors, spacing, and typography for readability

### CSS Classes Added

The following CSS classes are automatically applied:

2. Comparing the before/after views for both response types
3. Modifying the sample response text to test different formats
4. Testing with your actual backend responses

## Customization

The formatting can be customized by modifying:

- **CSS Variables** in `styles.css` for colors and spacing
- **Regex Patterns** in the formatting function for different text structures

- No external dependencies required
- Lightweight and performant
- Handles both simple text and complex markdown responses

## Support

For questions or issues with the response formatting:

1. Check the browser console for formatting logs
2. Verify the response text structure matches expected patterns
3. Test with the provided HTML test file
4. Review the CSS classes in the browser inspector
5. Check that the formatting function is properly integrated in all message handling paths

## Response Types Handled

The extension now handles these response formats:

1. **Simple Text**: Plain text responses that get basic formatting
2. **Markdown Headers**: Responses with ### headers for sections
3. **Citations**: Text with [1][2] reference numbers
4. **Source Links**: Both [Name](URL) and [1]: URL formats
5. **Structured Content**: Responses with numbered lists and bold headers
6. **Mixed Content**: Responses combining multiple formatting elements

This makes the extension versatile for handling various backend response structures automatically.

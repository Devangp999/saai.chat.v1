#### **E. Privacy Practices Tab** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Privacy Policy:**
- URL: `https://saai.dev/privacy-policy` (or wherever you hosted it)

**Single Purpose:**
```
Sa.AI is a Gmail productivity tool that provides AI-powered inbox 
summarization, email analysis, draft reply generation, and task 
management through a conversational interface.
```

**Justification for Permissions:**

**storage:**
```
Required to save user preferences, authentication tokens, and chat 
history locally in the browser for seamless user experience across 
sessions.
```

**identity:**
```
Used for secure Google OAuth authentication to access Gmail data 
with user consent.
```

**activeTab:**
```
Allows extension to interact with the active Gmail tab to inject 
the AI assistant interface.
```

**tabs:**
```
Required to detect when user is on Gmail and communicate between 
extension components (popup, background, content scripts).
```

**scripting:**
```
Enables dynamic injection of the AI assistant interface into Gmail 
when user activates the extension.
```

**alarms:**
```
Used for periodic session checks and token refresh to maintain 
seamless user experience.
```

**host_permissions - mail.google.com:**
```
Essential for the extension to function - injects the AI assistant 
sidebar directly into Gmail interface and reads email data for 
analysis.
```

**host_permissions - googleapis.com:**
```
Required for Gmail API access to:
- Read email metadata and content for summaries
- Create draft replies using gmail.compose scope
- Provide context-aware AI assistance
```

**host_permissions - connector.saai.dev:**
```
Our secure backend service that processes AI requests. Email data 
is sent here for analysis and stored in Pinecone for 30 days to 
enable context-aware responses.
```

**host_permissions - accounts.google.com:**
```
Required for Google OAuth authentication flow to securely connect 
Gmail accounts.
```

---

#### **F. Data Usage Disclosure** ⚠️ EXTREMELY CRITICAL

**Answer ALL questions accurately:**

**Does this extension collect or use user data?**
- ✅ YES

**What data is collected:**

**Personal Communications (Email):**
- [x] Collect: YES
- Purpose: AI analysis and context-aware assistance
- What: Email subject, sender, body, labels
- Transferred off device: YES → To connector.saai.dev
- How: HTTPS encryption
- Stored remotely: YES → Pinecone vector database
- Duration: 30 days, then auto-deleted
- Why: To provide intelligent, context-aware responses about user's email history

**Website Content:**
- [ ] Collect: NO

**User Activity:**
- [x] Collect: YES
- Purpose: Product improvement and debugging
- What: Feature usage patterns, error logs
- Transferred: YES → Analytics

---

#### **G. Sensitive Permissions Justification**

**gmail.compose (Sensitive Scope):**
```
We use the gmail.compose permission to automatically generate 
AI-powered draft replies in email threads. This saves users 
significant time by preparing intelligent, context-aware responses 
before they even open the thread.

How it works:
1. AI analyzes email thread context
2. Generates appropriate draft reply
3. Inserts draft into Gmail compose area
4. User reviews, edits, and sends

User benefit: Reduces email response time by 50-70%
User control: All drafts are reviewed before sending
Privacy: Draft content is generated from user's own emails
```
